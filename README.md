## Introduction

As part of the European project PANDEM 2, this pipeline is developped to analyse NGS samples (from the SRA database) and corresponding metadata. The steps performed are the mapping, the transformation of the SAM files, the variants calling and the creation of an experiment variant object. The output file is in .rds format.
